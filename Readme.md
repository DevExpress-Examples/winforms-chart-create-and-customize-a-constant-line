# How to add a constant line to an axis


This example demonstrates how a [constant line](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5783/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/axes/constant-lines) can be created and customized at runtime.

Since constant lines belong to a diagram's [axis](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5779/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram/axes), first it's required to cast your [diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5778/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram) object to the appropriate diagram's type. After that, it's possible to access axes and manage their constant lines collection.
