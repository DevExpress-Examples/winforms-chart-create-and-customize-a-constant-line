# Chart for WinForms - How to Create and Customize a Constant Line

This example demonstrates how create and customize a [constant line](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5783/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/axes/constant-lines) at runtime.

![Constant Line](image/chart.png)

Since constant lines belong to a diagram's [axis](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5779/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram/axes), you need to cast the [diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5778/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram) object to the appropriate diagram's type. After that, you can access axes and manage their constant lines collection.
